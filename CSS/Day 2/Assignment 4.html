    <h2 class="justify">Text alignment is essential in design because it controls the flow and readability of the content across various layouts.</h2>

    <p class="left">This paragraph is aligned to the left.</p>
    <p class="center">This paragraph is centered.</p>

    <h3>ðŸ“Œ Difference between Justify and Center:</h3>
    <p><strong>Justify</strong> spreads text so that both the left and right edges are aligned evenly (like in newspapers).<br>
       <strong>Center</strong> aligns text in the middle, leaving ragged edges on both sides.</p>
